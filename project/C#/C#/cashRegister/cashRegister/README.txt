OVERVIEW:

 Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple
 of sentences, you're going too far. The details go in other
 sections.


INCLUDED FILES:

cashRegister

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 I used and installed Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition on Windows 
 using the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 to create the class  cashRegister. 
 
 simply run the application

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 Learning how to use a mixture of a gui and coding was interesting to learn. Since C# is an OOP
 language it wasn't to difficult to figure my data structures and use them such as the list 
 collection. I was unable to get the total cost to compute

TESTING:

 I started testing the ide itself by following the tutorial posted
 on Trello. Then I went through some C# windows forms tutorials to emulate some Windows design 
 patterns. I would the forms numerous times and input different texts to see the ouputs i would 
 get. 


DISCUSSION:
 
 Once I went through some tutorials I had a much better sense of confidence. I liked how similar
 the langauge is to java and the Visual Studio ide is superb as well.
